    "title": "The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery",
    "abstract": "One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

    "abstract": "AI is increasingly playing a pivotal role in transforming how scientific discoveries are made. We introduce The AI Scientist-v2, an end-to-end agentic system capable of producing the first entirely AI generated peer-review-accepted workshop paper. This system iteratively formulates scientific hypotheses, designs and executes experiments, analyzes and visualizes data, and autonomously authors scientific manuscripts. Compared to its predecessor (v1, Lu et al., 2024 arXiv:2408.06292), The AI Scientist-v2 eliminates the reliance on human-authored code templates, generalizes effectively across diverse machine learning domains, and leverages a novel progressive agentic tree-search methodology managed by a dedicated experiment manager agent. Additionally, we enhance the AI reviewer component by integrating a Vision-Language Model (VLM) feedback loop for iterative refinement of content and aesthetics of the figures. We evaluated The AI Scientist-v2 by submitting three fully autonomous manuscripts to a peer-reviewed ICLR workshop. Notably, one manuscript achieved high enough scores to exceed the average human acceptance threshold, marking the first instance of a fully AI-generated paper successfully navigating a peer review. This accomplishment highlights the growing capability of AI in conducting all aspects of scientific research. We anticipate that further advancements in autonomous scientific discovery technologies will profoundly impact human knowledge generation, enabling unprecedented scalability in research productivity and significantly accelerating scientific breakthroughs, greatly benefiting society at large. We have open-sourced the code at https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist-v2 to foster the future development of this transformative technology. We also discuss the role of AI in science, including AI safety.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large‐scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi‐agent systems with in‐situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up‐to‐date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a “swarm of intelligence” similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy‐efficient production is shown.",

    "abstract": "Automated scientific discovery promises to accelerate progress across scientific domains. However, developing and evaluating an AI agent's capacity for end-to-end scientific reasoning is challenging as running real-world experiments is often prohibitively expensive or infeasible. In this work we introduce DISCOVERYWORLD, the first virtual environment for developing and benchmarking an agent's ability to perform complete cycles of novel scientific discovery. DISCOVERYWORLD contains a variety of different challenges, covering topics as diverse as radioisotope dating, rocket science, and proteomics, to encourage development of general discovery skills rather than task-specific solutions. DISCOVERYWORLD itself is an inexpensive, simulated, text-based environment (with optional 2D visual overlay). It includes 120 different challenge tasks, spanning eight topics each with three levels of difficulty and several parametric variations. Each task requires an agent to form hypotheses, design and run experiments, analyze results, and act on conclusions. DISCOVERYWORLD further provides three automatic metrics for evaluating performance, based on (a) task completion, (b) task-relevant actions taken, and (c) the discovered explanatory knowledge. We find that strong baseline agents, that perform well in prior published environments, struggle on most DISCOVERYWORLD tasks, suggesting that DISCOVERYWORLD captures some of the novel challenges of discovery, and thus that DISCOVERYWORLD may help accelerate near-term development and assessment of scientific discovery competency in agents.

We then outline key challenges and promising research directions toward developing more comprehensive AI systems for scientific discovery, including the need for science-focused AI agents, improved benchmarks and evaluation metrics, multimodal scientific representations, and unified frameworks combining reasoning, theorem proving, and data-driven modeling.

Recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven methods to rapidly screen or generate promising materials, but these methods still depend heavily on very large quantities of training data and often lack the flexibility and chemical understanding often desired in materials discovery. We introduce LLMatDesign, a novel language-based framework for interpretable materials design powered by large language models (LLMs). LLMatDesign utilizes LLM agents to translate human instructions, apply modifications to materials, and evaluate outcomes using provided tools. By incorporating self-reflection on its previous decisions, LLMatDesign adapts rapidly to new tasks and conditions in a zero-shot manner. A systematic evaluation of LLMatDesign on several materials design tasks, in silico, validates LLMatDesign's effectiveness in developing new materials with user-defined target properties in the small data regime. Our framework demonstrates the remarkable potential of autonomous LLM-guided materials discovery in the computational setting and towards self-driving laboratories in the future.",

Current scientific practices face substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage -- spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both physical and intellectual frontiers.",

    "abstract": "The paper surveys automated scientific discovery, from equation discovery and symbolic regression to autonomous discovery systems and agents. It discusses the individual approaches from a\"big picture\"perspective and in context, but also discusses open issues and recent topics like the various roles of deep neural networks in this area, aiding in the discovery of human-interpretable knowledge. Further, we will present closed-loop scientific discovery systems, starting with the pioneering work on the Adam system up to current efforts in fields from material science to astronomy. Finally, we will elaborate on autonomy from a machine learning perspective, but also in analogy to the autonomy levels in autonomous driving. The maximal level, level five, is defined to require no human intervention at all in the production of scientific knowledge. Achieving this is one step towards solving the Nobel Turing Grand Challenge to develop AI Scientists: AI systems capable of making Nobel-quality scientific discoveries highly autonomously at a level comparable, and possibly superior, to the best human scientists by 2050.",

However, the agentic frameworks used to build these systems have not previously enabled use with research cyberinfrastructure. Here we introduce Academy, a modular and extensible middleware designed to deploy autonomous agents across the federated research ecosystem, including HPC systems, experimental facilities, and data repositories. To meet the demands of scientific computing, Academy supports asynchronous execution, heterogeneous resources, high-throughput data flows, and dynamic resource availability. It provides abstractions for expressing stateful agents, managing inter-agent coordination, and integrating computation with experimental control. We present microbenchmark results that demonstrate high performance and scalability in HPC environments. To demonstrate the breadth of applications that can be supported by agentic workflow designs, we also present case studies in materials discovery, decentralized learning, and information extraction in which agents are deployed across diverse HPC systems.",

    "abstract": "AI models for science [14] have the potential to harness large datasets, accelerate scientific discoveries and transform numerous fields. For example, AlphaFold [13] has accurately predicted protein structures, significantly reducing research time in biology and medicine. Similarly, AI has been used to identify compounds for diseases like COVID-19 [10] and Cancer [21], dramatically shortening the timelines for breakthroughs in healthcare. In mathematics, AlphaTensor [7] has discovered faster algorithms for matrix-matrix multiplication than Strassen's algorithm. AI systems have been applied in fields such as healthcare [10, 21], material science [15], physics [19], mathematics [7], education [16], psychology [18], and software development [20].

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from specialized computational tools into autonomous research partners. We position Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm, where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency. Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives -- process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i) trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.",

Our framework seamlessly orchestrates the complete research pipeline--from literature review and hypothesis generation to algorithm implementation and publication-ready manuscript preparation--with minimal human intervention. To rigorously assess autonomous research capabilities, we develop Scientist-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising state-of-the-art papers across diverse AI research domains, featuring both guided innovation and open-ended exploration tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AI-Researcher achieves remarkable implementation success rates and produces research papers that approach human-level quality.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates how intuitions about scientific discovery using artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve our understanding of scientific discovery more generally. Traditional accounts of discovery have been agent-centred: they place emphasis on identifying a specific agent who is responsible for conducting all, or at least the important part, of a discovery process. We argue that these accounts experience difficulties capturing scientific discovery involving AI and that similar issues arise for human discovery. We propose an alternative, collective-centred view as superior for understanding discovery, with and without AI. This view maintains that discovery is performed by a collective of agents and entities, each making contributions that differ in significance and character, and that attributing credit for discovery depends on various finer-grained properties of the contributions made. Detailing its conceptual resources, we argue that this view is considerably more compelling than its agent-centred alternative. Considering and responding to several theoretical and practical challenges, we point to concrete avenues for further developing the view we propose.",

This paper introduces a novel AI framework, Tippy, that transforms laboratory automation through specialized AI agents operating within the Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycle.

Tippy represents the first production-ready implementation of specialized AI agents for automating the DMTA cycle, providing a concrete example of how AI can transform laboratory workflows. By leveraging autonomous AI agents that reason, plan, and collaborate, we demonstrate how Tippy accelerates DMTA cycles while maintaining scientific rigor essential for pharmaceutical research.

We examine agentic AI’s definition and historical foundations, the theoretical underpinnings of agency, system architectures, and applications. We consider some of the leading LLM-agenting frameworks (Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, LangChain agents) and the essential components that facilitate agency, e.g., memory, planning, tool usage, and feedback mechanisms. We evaluate benchmarks for agents (AgentBench and TheAgentCompany), and outline applications in various domains from software engineering to scientific discovery. We discuss major challenges faced by agentic AI (alignment, control, interpretability, safety), and the potential paths forward, including metrics for agency, dynamic alignment mechanisms, and governance. Throughout, we illustrate how agentic AI takes us further along the journey from narrow AI to general, goal-driven autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing self driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research, promising unprecedented acceleration of scientific discovery. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.",

    "title": "Open-ended Scientific Discovery via Bayesian Surprise",
    "abstract": "The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses, our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms competitors by producing 5--29\\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM. Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward towards building open-ended ASD systems.",

    "abstract": "Scientific discovery is being revolutionized by AI and autonomous systems, yet current autonomous laboratories remain isolated islands unable to collaborate across institutions. We present the Autonomous Interconnected Science Lab Ecosystem (AISLE), a grassroots network transforming fragmented capabilities into a unified system that shorten the path from ideation to innovation to impact and accelerates discovery from decades to months. AISLE addresses five critical dimensions: (1) cross-institutional equipment orchestration, (2) intelligent data management with FAIR compliance, (3) AI-agent driven orchestration grounded in scientific principles, (4) interoperable agent communication interfaces, and (5) AI/ML-integrated scientific education. By connecting autonomous agents across institutional boundaries, autonomous science can unlock research spaces inaccessible to traditional approaches while democratizing cutting-edge technologies. This paradigm shift toward collaborative autonomous science promises breakthroughs in sustainable energy, materials development, and public health.",

    "abstract": "AI is revolutionizing scientific discovery by connecting seemingly unrelated fields - from mechanics to biology, and science to art. However, how can we build AI models that don't merely retrieve information but make new discoveries, going beyond interpolation to extrapolate to reason over never-before-seen scenarios and concepts? In this talk we describe how a new generation of physics-aware AI is breaking traditional boundaries through: Innovative graph-based generative AI combining physics and data-driven modeling Biologically-inspired neural structures that adapt dynamically Multi-agent systems that mirror natural systems Through practical case studies, I will present how this technology transforms materials science across scales - from silk and collagen to biomineralized materials - with direct applications in medicine, food systems, and agriculture. The versatility in agent development allows for expertise in diverse domains, including knowledge retrieval, protein structure analysis, physics-based simulations, and results analysis, is presented. The dynamic collaboration between agents, empowered by LLMs that can reason over sequences, data, images, and text, provides a versatile approach to tackling protein design and analysis problems, as demonstrated through diverse examples in this study.",

However, the generation of precise and regulation-compliant diagrams remains a significant challenge, particularly in scaling breakthroughs from material discovery to industrial production in an era of automation and digitalization. This paper introduces an autonomous agentic framework to address these challenges through a twostage approach involving knowledge acquisition and generation. The framework integrates specialized sub-agents for retrieving and synthesizing multimodal data from publicly available online sources and constructs ontological knowledge graphs using a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) paradigm. These capabilities enable the automation of diagram generation and open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks with high contextual accuracy. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the frameworks ability to deliver regulation-compliant diagrams with minimal expert intervention, highlighting its practical utility for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "The surge in scientific publications challenges traditional review methods, demanding tools that integrate structured metadata with full-text analysis. Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility. Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking). Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics. On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline, achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall Context Precision. Additional gains include 0.24 in VS Faithfulness, 0.12 in both VS Precision and KG Answer Relevance, 0.11 in overall Faithfulness score, 0.05 in KG Context Recall, and 0.04 in both VS Answer Relevance and overall Precision. These results highlight the system's improved reasoning over heterogeneous sources and establish a scalable framework for autonomous, agentic scientific discovery.",

In this position paper, we argue that interoperability, achieved by the adoption of minimal standards, is essential to ensure open, secure, web-scale, and widely-adopted agentic ecosystems. To this end, we devise a minimal architectural foundation for collaborative agentic AI, named Web of Agents, which is composed of four components: agent-to-agent messaging, interaction interoperability, state management, and agent discovery. Web of Agents adopts existing standards and reuses existing infrastructure where possible. With Web of Agents, we take the first but critical step toward interoperable agentic systems and offer a pragmatic path forward before ecosystem fragmentation becomes the norm.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing urban freight logistics is critical for developing sustainable, low-carbon cities. Traditional methods often rely on manual coordination of simulation tools, optimization solvers, and expert-driven workflows, limiting their efficiency and scalability. This paper presents an agentic system architecture that leverages the model context protocol (MCP) to orchestrate multi-agent collaboration among scientific tools for autonomous, simulation-informed optimization in urban logistics. The system integrates generative AI agents with domain-specific engines - such as Gurobi for optimization and AnyLogic for agent-based simulation - forming a generative digital twin capable of reasoning, planning, and acting across multimodal freight networks. By incorporating integrated chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation, and structured memory, the framework enables agents to interpret user intent from natural language conversations, retrieve relevant datasets and models, coordinate solvers and simulators, and execute complex workflows. We demonstrate this approach through a freight decarbonization case study, showcasing how MCP enables modular, interoperable, and adaptive agent behavior across diverse toolchains. The results reveal that our system transforms digital twins from static visualizations into autonomous, decision-capable systems, advancing the frontiers of urban operations research. By enabling context-aware, generative agents to operate scientific tools automatically and collaboratively, this framework supports more intelligent, accessible, and dynamic decision-making in transportation planning and smart city management.",

    "abstract": "The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.",

    "abstract": ": The recent advances in Generative AI have renewed the discussion around Auto-GPT, a form of autonomous agent that can execute complex tasks, e.g., make a sale, plan a trip, etc. We focus on the discovery aspect of agents, i.e., identifying the agent(s) capable of executing a given task. This implies that there exists a marketplace with a registry of agents - with a well-defined description of the agent capabilities and constraints. In this paper, we outline a constraints based model to specify agent services. We show how the constraints of a composite agent can be derived and described in a manner consistent with respect to the constraints of its component agents. Finally, we discuss approximate matchmaking, and show how the notion of bounded inconsistency can be exploited to discover agents more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers, and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem. Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content; existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted, reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

    "abstract": "The role of scientists and engineers is being significantly reshaped by the increased role of artificial intelligence (AI) across various science domains. Materials science is a field that is well-positioned to benefit from the integration of AI in the design of automated experimental systems. This is especially true for systems that are collecting and analyzing massive quantities of data from scanning electron microscopes (SEM). The associated SEM imagery is on the nanoscale, offering unprecedented fidelity to analyze materials in their most basic and simple structures. However, the richness and potential volume of this data necessitate human-machine teaming, specifically AI tools to accelerate scientific discovery. This paper details how the foundation AI vision Segment Anything Model (SAM) is leveraged within an experimental workflow. Specifically, SAM’s basic use requires significant human-in-the-loop effort to mark relevant areas. Herein, we detail how SAM creates excessive segmentation masks and describe the necessary post-processing to refine and filter outputs to be suitable for an autonomous materials experimentation pipeline. Our vision system design that leverages SAM coupled with classical computer vision as a post-processing stage achieves 98–100% precision isolating Aluminum nanoparticles within SEM images.",

    "abstract": "\n \n \n Modern chemical biology and multi-omics approaches capture far more data than can be digested in human readable form, creating an opportunity for machine-based methods to significantly expand the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to fill this gap, however significant challenges remain to adapt machine learning (ML) based approaches to data that is noisy, complex, and bespoke while still preserving the transparency required for scientific and regulatory decision making. Herein we describe a novel approach combining knowledge graphs and centrality algorithms, allowing the construction of systems that are scalable, robust to noise, concise, and perhaps most importantly, highly transparent. The central construct, which we have termed a “focal graph”, can seamlessly integrate information across multiple, diverse, complex data sets, including large-scale chemical biology and multi-omics data. Focal graphs can be combined with agentic large language models (LLMs) as part of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategies to build intelligent, autonomous workflows for discovery of new targets, biomarkers, and combination treatment strategies. Importantly, unlike ML methods, our focal graph approach preserves the provenance of the underlying experimental data, allowing the processes and conclusions to be examined and evaluated in tremendous detail by human or machine-based methods. Using focal graphs combined with agentic LLMs and workflow automation, we can plan and execute research programs that lead to the discovery of entirely novel biological insights, including new potential biomarkers, original drug targets, drug repurposing strategies, and combination therapy hypotheses. Here we present the theoretical underpinnings of focal graphs and their automation, as well as sharing selected findings related to novel disease therapeutic and biomarker strategies. These results derive their support from multiple, diverse, large-scale experimental data sets, with full transparency with respect to the experimental basis of the discoveries. As these autonomous systems become more sophisticated and are given access to more data and computational power, they can be expected to generate insights with increasing levels of novelty and experimental support.

    "abstract": "Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly autonomous agentic systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities to accelerate drug discovery by improving in-silico modeling and reducing dependence on costly experimental trials. Current AI agent-based systems demonstrate proficiency in solving programming challenges and conducting research, indicating an emerging potential to develop software capable of addressing complex problems such as pharmaceutical design and drug discovery. This paper introduces DO Challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate the decision-making abilities of AI agents in a single, complex problem resembling virtual screening scenarios. The benchmark challenges systems to independently develop, implement, and execute efficient strategies for identifying promising molecular structures from extensive datasets, while navigating chemical space, selecting models, and managing limited resources in a multi-objective context. We also discuss insights from the DO Challenge 2025, a competition based on the proposed benchmark, which showcased diverse strategies explored by human participants. Furthermore, we present the Deep Thought multi-agent system, which demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, outperforming most human teams. Among the language models tested, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 performed best in primary agent roles, and GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash were effective in auxiliary roles. While promising, the system's performance still fell short of expert-designed solutions and showed high instability, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of AI-driven methodologies in transforming drug discovery and broader scientific research.",

    "title": "Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?",
    "abstract": "The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of\"agentic\"in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.",

    "abstract": "Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm that relies on a large number of specialized AI agents to collaborate and coordinate for autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex goal achievement. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management alongside capabilities for self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex networking environments, laying the foundation for fully autonomous networking systems in the future. Despite its promise, AgentNet is still in the early stage of development, and there still lacks an effective networking framework to support automatic goal discovery and multi-agent self-orchestration and task assignment. This paper proposes SANNet, a novel semantic-aware agentic AI networking architecture that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of a mobile system to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that one of the major challenges in AgentNet is that different agents may have different and even conflicting objectives when collaborating for certain goals, we introduce a dynamic weighting-based conflict-resolving mechanism to address this issue. We prove that SANNet can provide theoretical guarantee in both conflict-resolving and model generalization performance for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environment. We develop a hardware prototype of SANNet based on the open RAN and 5GS core platform. Our experimental results show that SANNet can significantly improve the performance of multi-agent networking systems, even when agents with conflicting objectives are selected to collaborate for the same goal.",

    "title": "Abstract 2460: Judith: An agentic AI system for biomedical image analysis and scientific discovery in precision oncology",
    "abstract": "\n The rapidly increasing volume of multimodal biomedical data presents unprecedented opportunities in precision oncology but poses significant challenges for researchers analyzing complex modalities such as gigapixel pathology slides. To address these challenges, we developed Judith, an AI-driven research assistant that leverages foundation models, multimodal generative AI, and other advanced computational tools for streamlining complex workflows in biomedical image analysis, predictive modeling, and biomarker discovery. Judith enables researchers to execute computational tasks through natural language commands, automating tasks such as response prediction, multimodal cancer prognosis, and histopathology image retrieval. We demonstrate Judith’s capabilities in several precision oncology use cases. (1) Predictive modeling and biomarker discovery: Using a retrospective dataset of pretreatment biopsies from invasive breast carcinoma patients treated with Trastuzumab (n=85 patients), Judith trained an AI model that predicts pathologic complete response with an AUROC of 0.855. Judith could also interpret the model, identifying key cellular features linked to tumor proliferation and finding histologic biomarkers that explain cohort-level differences between responders and non-responders. (2) Multimodal data integration: Judith orchestrated the development of a survival prediction model integrating histology, radiology, and multi-omics data for progression-free survival prediction in low-grade glioma patients (n=127), achieving a C-Index of 0.684. Using an integrative analysis, Judith further stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups and identified unfavorable prognostic features for cancer progression such as high tumor cellularity and PSPH overexpression. (3) Histology slide retrieval: Judith automated the development of a histology slide search system (n=138), enabling pathologists to retrieve slides with similar cancer diagnoses and morphologies. Judith was then able to validate the performance of histology slide retrieval, with successful retrieval of rare cancer types such as leiomyosarcoma. Overall, Judith represents a major advancement in biomedical research by automating AI workflows and enhancing data-driven discovery. Its ability to analyze diverse data modalities, identify meaningful biomarkers, and generate interpretable insights empowers researchers to maximize the scientific insights in their data.

    "abstract": "This new breed of agentic AI systems, the ability to act on their own, towards their goal, is transforming the digital commerce environment through fabulous intelligent search and recommendation applications. When integrated through conversational agents on e-commerce websites, these systems string together customer experiences, optimize the product discovery process, and personalize the compendium on a real-time basis. Yet, as these agents become more autonomous, explainability, transparency, and fairness become essential to trust by the users and regulatory compliance. The following article is about the incorporation of the practice of Explainable AI (XAI) in the agentic systems of retail search, specifically in conversational commerce. It presents the shortcomings of transparency in existing implementations and postulates a conceptual model of several mutually tied elements: the Goal Engine as an intention disambiguation system, the Perception Layer as a query interpreter, the Decision Core as a recommendation logic system, the Memory Store as the personalization auditing unit, and the Feedback Loop designed to evaluate performance. The article explains the methods of architectural implementation and the main capabilities that could be used in order to provide a trustworthy AI-based shopping experience. It ends with an inquiry on the business case of explainability, showing how explainable systems provide higher customer loyalty, lessening regulatory risk exposure, better debugging operations, and more effective personalization in e-commerce settings.",

    "title": "Abstract 3509: Using generative AI for filtering and comprehension of drug target discovery screen results",
    "abstract": "\n Recent advancements in generative AI, including models such as GPT-4 and LLAMA2, have been rapidly integrated into cancer research. Cellformatica, Inc. has developed a pipeline designed to enhance the accuracy of functional and genomic drug target discovery screens by reducing the incidence of false positives and refining the interpretation process. This pipeline is capable of conducting comprehensive investigations, including genome-wide analyses, and is accessible via web and API interfaces. At the core of the pipeline is the use of the extensive global corpus of scientific literature to assess the relevance of each gene within the context defined by the experimental design of the screen. To address the issue of AI-generated inaccuracies, often referred to as 'hallucinations,' the pipeline incorporates a custom-tuned language model (LLM) component within the generative AI framework. This fine-tuning process is specifically tailored to the gene set under investigation. The pipeline's multi-agent architecture is a distinctive feature. It scores candidates based on three orthogonally-tuned criteria: effectiveness, confidence, and novelty. In benchmarking tests, this multi-agent scoring system has outperformed GPT-4 and has proven particularly adept at identifying candidate targets that may have been overlooked in previous research. These candidates are recognized for their significant therapeutic potential and are corroborated by existing scientific findings. The versatility of the Cellformatica pipeline is demonstrated through its application in three distinct areas of cancer research. First, it has been employed to optimize chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, a form of immunotherapy for cancer treatment. Second, the pipeline has been used to elucidate the network of chemotactic molecules that orchestrate immune cell infiltration and tissue remodeling in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Third, it has been used to spatially define signaling pathways in humanized xenograft murine tumor experiments, for which existing cross-species database knowledge is limited. These applications underscore the pipeline's potential to contribute to the understanding and treatment of complex diseases.\n Citation Format: Andrew Rech, Yury Goltsev, Nikolay Samusik, Anna Kaznadzey.
