While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

We introduce The AI Scientist-v2, an end-to-end agentic system capable of producing the first entirely AI generated peer-review-accepted workshop paper. This system iteratively formulates scientific hypotheses, designs and executes experiments, analyzes and visualizes data, and autonomously authors scientific manuscripts. Compared to its predecessor (v1, Lu et al., 2024 arXiv:2408.06292), The AI Scientist-v2 eliminates the reliance on human-authored code templates, generalizes effectively across diverse machine learning domains, and leverages a novel progressive agentic tree-search methodology managed by a dedicated experiment manager agent. Additionally, we enhance the AI reviewer component by integrating a Vision-Language Model (VLM) feedback loop for iterative refinement of content and aesthetics of the figures. We evaluated The AI Scientist-v2 by submitting three fully autonomous manuscripts to a peer-reviewed ICLR workshop. Notably, one manuscript achieved high enough scores to exceed the average human acceptance threshold, marking the first instance of a fully AI-generated paper successfully navigating a peer review. This accomplishment highlights the growing capability of AI in conducting all aspects of scientific research.

In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large‐scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi‐agent systems with in‐situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up‐to‐date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a “swarm of intelligence” similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery.

However, developing and evaluating an AI agent's capacity for end-to-end scientific reasoning is challenging as running real-world experiments is often prohibitively expensive or infeasible. In this work we introduce DISCOVERYWORLD, the first virtual environment for developing and benchmarking an agent's ability to perform complete cycles of novel scientific discovery. DISCOVERYWORLD contains a variety of different challenges, covering topics as diverse as radioisotope dating, rocket science, and proteomics, to encourage development of general discovery skills rather than task-specific solutions. DISCOVERYWORLD itself is an inexpensive, simulated, text-based environment (with optional 2D visual overlay). It includes 120 different challenge tasks, spanning eight topics each with three levels of difficulty and several parametric variations. Each task requires an agent to form hypotheses, design and run experiments, analyze results, and act on conclusions. DISCOVERYWORLD further provides three automatic metrics for evaluating performance, based on (a) task completion, (b) task-relevant actions taken, and (c) the discovered explanatory knowledge. We find that strong baseline agents, that perform well in prior published environments, struggle on most DISCOVERYWORLD tasks, suggesting that DISCOVERYWORLD captures some of the novel challenges of discovery, and thus that DISCOVERYWORLD may help accelerate near-term development and assessment of scientific discovery competency in agents.

Traditional accounts of discovery have been agent-centred: they place emphasis on identifying a specific agent who is responsible for conducting all, or at least the important part, of a discovery process. We argue that these accounts experience difficulties capturing scientific discovery involving AI and that similar issues arise for human discovery. We propose an alternative, collective-centred view as superior for understanding discovery, with and without AI. This view maintains that discovery is performed by a collective of agents and entities, each making contributions that differ in significance and character, and that attributing credit for discovery depends on various finer-grained properties of the contributions made. Detailing its conceptual resources, we argue that this view is considerably more compelling than its agent-centred alternative.

Most recent works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses, our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.

Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.

However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.",2025,"['Tatiana Petrova', 'Boris Bliznioukov', 'Aleksandr Puzikov', 'Radu State']",arXiv.org,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a71c1ba5e7a2bf0631bfeee6922d4efe24f8beba,,10.48550/arXiv.2507.10644,1,0.5593612790107727,0.50977928402387

This implies that there exists a marketplace with a registry of agents - with a well-defined description of the agent capabilities and constraints. In this paper, we outline a constraints based model to specify agent services. We show how the constraints of a composite agent can be derived and described in a manner consistent with respect to the constraints of its component agents.

Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content; existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists.

It also provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv.

 Modern chemical biology and multi-omics approaches capture far more data than can be digested in human readable form, creating an opportunity for machine-based methods to significantly expand the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to fill this gap, however significant challenges remain to adapt machine learning (ML) based approaches to data that is noisy, complex, and bespoke while still preserving the transparency required for scientific and regulatory decision making. Herein we describe a novel approach combining knowledge graphs and centrality algorithms, allowing the construction of systems that are scalable, robust to noise, concise, and perhaps most importantly, highly transparent. The central construct, which we have termed a “focal graph”, can seamlessly integrate information across multiple, diverse, complex data sets, including large-scale chemical biology and multi-omics data. Focal graphs can be combined with agentic large language models (LLMs) as part of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategies to build intelligent, autonomous workflows for discovery of new targets, biomarkers, and combination treatment strategies. Importantly, unlike ML methods, our focal graph approach preserves the provenance of the underlying experimental data, allowing the processes and conclusions to be examined and evaluated in tremendous detail by human or machine-based methods. Using focal graphs combined with agentic LLMs and workflow automation, we can plan and execute research programs that lead to the discovery of entirely novel biological insights, including new potential biomarkers, original drug targets, drug repurposing strategies, and combination therapy hypotheses. Here we present the theoretical underpinnings of focal graphs and their automation, as well as sharing selected findings related to novel disease therapeutic and biomarker strategies. These results derive their support from multiple, diverse, large-scale experimental data sets, with full transparency with respect to the experimental basis of the discoveries. As these autonomous systems become more sophisticated and are given access to more data and computational power, they can be expected to generate insights with increasing levels of novelty and experimental support.

A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator.

This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of""agentic""in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others.

 The rapidly increasing volume of multimodal biomedical data presents unprecedented opportunities in precision oncology but poses significant challenges for researchers analyzing complex modalities such as gigapixel pathology slides. To address these challenges, we developed Judith, an AI-driven research assistant that leverages foundation models, multimodal generative AI, and other advanced computational tools for streamlining complex workflows in biomedical image analysis, predictive modeling, and biomarker discovery. Judith enables researchers to execute computational tasks through natural language commands, automating tasks such as response prediction, multimodal cancer prognosis, and histopathology image retrieval. We demonstrate Judith’s capabilities in several precision oncology use cases. (1) Predictive modeling and biomarker discovery: Using a retrospective dataset of pretreatment biopsies from invasive breast carcinoma patients treated with Trastuzumab (n=85 patients), Judith trained an AI model that predicts pathologic complete response with an AUROC of 0.855. Judith could also interpret the model, identifying key cellular features linked to tumor proliferation and finding histologic biomarkers that explain cohort-level differences between responders and non-responders. (2) Multimodal data integration: Judith orchestrated the development of a survival prediction model integrating histology, radiology, and multi-omics data for progression-free survival prediction in low-grade glioma patients (n=127), achieving a C-Index of 0.684. Using an integrative analysis, Judith further stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups and identified unfavorable prognostic features for cancer progression such as high tumor cellularity and PSPH overexpression. (3) Histology slide retrieval: Judith automated the development of a histology slide search system (n=138), enabling pathologists to retrieve slides with similar cancer diagnoses and morphologies. Judith was then able to validate the performance of histology slide retrieval, with successful retrieval of rare cancer types such as leiomyosarcoma. Overall, Judith represents a major advancement in biomedical research by automating AI workflows and enhancing data-driven discovery. Its ability to analyze diverse data modalities, identify meaningful biomarkers, and generate interpretable insights empowers researchers to maximize the scientific insights in their data. Future developments will focus on expanding multimodal capabilities, refining interpretability tools, and integrating real-time collaboration features.

 Recent advancements in generative AI, including models such as GPT-4 and LLAMA2, have been rapidly integrated into cancer research. Cellformatica, Inc. has developed a pipeline designed to enhance the accuracy of functional and genomic drug target discovery screens by reducing the incidence of false positives and refining the interpretation process. This pipeline is capable of conducting comprehensive investigations, including genome-wide analyses, and is accessible via web and API interfaces. At the core of the pipeline is the use of the extensive global corpus of scientific literature to assess the relevance of each gene within the context defined by the experimental design of the screen. To address the issue of AI-generated inaccuracies, often referred to as 'hallucinations,' the pipeline incorporates a custom-tuned language model (LLM) component within the generative AI framework. This fine-tuning process is specifically tailored to the gene set under investigation. The pipeline's multi-agent architecture is a distinctive feature. It scores candidates based on three orthogonally-tuned criteria: effectiveness, confidence, and novelty. In benchmarking tests, this multi-agent scoring system has outperformed GPT-4 and has proven particularly adept at identifying candidate targets that may have been overlooked in previous research. These candidates are recognized for their significant therapeutic potential and are corroborated by existing scientific findings. The versatility of the Cellformatica pipeline is demonstrated through its application in three distinct areas of cancer research. First, it has been employed to optimize chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, a form of immunotherapy for cancer treatment. Second, the pipeline has been used to elucidate the network of chemotactic molecules that orchestrate immune cell infiltration and tissue remodeling in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Third, it has been used to spatially define signaling pathways in humanized xenograft murine tumor experiments, for which existing cross-species database knowledge is limited. These applications underscore the pipeline's potential to contribute to the understanding and treatment of complex diseases.
